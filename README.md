Hey, my name's Cooper Sullivan and I'm a computer science student who likes to write software for random things I enjoy in my free time. I write a lot of modifications for games I currently play (which *always* includes Minecraft), so you'll see a lot of those projects on my profile. Besides that, I usually like to create programs that solve any sort of problem I tend to have. It almost never works out in my favor but, hey, at least I'm trying!
